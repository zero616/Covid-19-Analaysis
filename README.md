## Overview

Each year in the United States, about one in five teens is bullied at school. When COVID-19 interferes with in-person interactions, we use Internet search data from Google Trend to track bullying patterns. We found an overall downward trend in searches about bullying and cyberbullying in schools as schools shift to online learning in the spring of 2020. This finding debunks the idea that cyberbullying increases as students become more exposed to technology, explaining the impact of epidemics on student mental health and providing ideas for future responses to cyber and school bullying.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
